TODO Items
-----------------

- Split up ".js" files to a more "componentized" model so only the scripts that
are needed get included.

- Google - Be able to define "marker.showMapBlowup();", instead of normal InfoWindow.



Cool Features to look into, maybe
---------------------------------
- Possibly use compiled partial views (.ascx) within DLL for rendering the markup and js init code.
